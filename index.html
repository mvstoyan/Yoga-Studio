               <p id="text">Emotions make us human–they connect and alienate, elate and destroy.</p>
               <p id="text">When it comes to emotions, meditation is a wonderfully effective technique 
                  that works on a good many levels. When we train in mindfulness, we learn to let 
                  go of the storyline and simply be with what we’re experiencing in the moment. 
                  With awareness practice, we gain insights into the very nature of emotions and 
                  their manifold expressions.

         <h2>Mental Health</h2>
         <p id="text">With its emphasis on breathing practices and medita­tion—both of which help calm and center the 
            mind— it’s hardly surprising that yoga also brings mental benefits, such as reduced anxiety and 
            depression. What may be more surprising is that it actually makes your brain work better.
         </p>
         <p id="text">When you lift weights, your muscles get stronger and bigger. When you do yoga, your brain cells 
            develop new connections, and changes occur in brain struc­ture as well as function, resulting in 
            improved cog­nitive skills, such as learning and memory. Yoga strengthens parts of the brain that 
            play a key role in memory, attention, awareness, thought, and language. Think of it as weightlifting 
            for the brain.
         </p>
         <p id="text">Studies using MRI scans and other brain imaging technology have shown that people who regularly did 
            yoga had a thicker cerebral cortex (the area of the brain responsible for information processing) 
            and hippocampus (the area of the brain involved in learn­ing and memory) compared with nonpractitioners. 
            These areas of the brain typically shrink as you age, but the older yoga practitioners showed less 
            shrinkage than those who did no yoga. This suggests that yoga may counteract age-related declines 
            in memory and other cognitive skills.

         <h2>What Is Mantra Meditation?</h2>
         <p id="text">A mantra is a syllable, word, or phrase that is repeated during meditation. Mantras can be spoken, 
            chanted, whispered, or repeated in the mind. Most mantra meditation techniques have two essential 
            components: mindfulness meditation and mantra recitation or chanting. While this age-old practice 
            is known to have Buddhist and Hindu roots, forms of “sacred word” recitation exist within a great 
            variety of spiritual traditions, including Judeo-Christian and Shamanic. Nowadays, mantra practice 
            is also gaining popularity as part of secular mindfulness practice.
         </p>
         <p id="text">People do mantra meditation for different reasons. For some, it serves as a kind of mental protection
            against unwelcome distractions or emotions, as when battling sleeplessness or coping with fears 
            associated with travel. For others, mantra meditation serves a deeper spiritual purpose. In certain 
            Hindu and ancient Christian traditions, for example, mantra recitation is used to focus the mind-heart 
            and connect with the divine, both within and without. In Buddhism, one of the benefits of mantra 
            recitation is that it helps keep the mind focused and receptive to the blessings of the present moment. 
            As Buddhism is a non-thesitic tradition, mantra serves to evoke positive qualities and confidence 
            rather than an external deity.
         </p>
         <h2>How to do mantra meditation</h2>
         <p id="text">1. Find the best mantras to suit your intention

         <p id="text">2. Get comfortable and remember your intention</p>
